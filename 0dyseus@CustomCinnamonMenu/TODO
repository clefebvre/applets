Custom Cinnamon Menu applet ToDo list:
  ☐ **Make the list of recently executed applications global:** Currently, the list of recently executed applications (**Recent applications** category) is stored in a per applet manner. If there are various menu applets placed in different panels, each of them will have their own list of recent applications and each of those lists will be different. @low
    Maybe store them into a gsetting?
    Maybe store them in a .json file inside the ~/.cinnamon/configs/applet@UUID directory?
  ☐ **Devise a way to highlight categories that contain recently installed software:** @low
    Create a category that holds only the recently installed software? Set it to show/hide depending on the existence of recently installed applications? I think that I saw a menu in another desktop environment that did exactly this, but I can't remember which one.
    Simply set a custom style for these categories?
  ☐ **Mainloop.idle_add_full:**  Using the **Mainloop.idle_add_full** callback on categories selection is more annoying than useful. It seems that its purpose is to avoid undesired categories selection, but it's failing miserably. So, for now, avoid it at all cost. Keeping the removed option **Category selection delay** is more effective and it's up to the user to use it or not. @ultralow
  ☐ **Re-evaluate the calculations in the vector boxes creation:** With the option called **Swap categories box** enabled, the calculations on the functions that create the vector boxes are erroneous. Must find a way to correct those calculations. @ultralow

 ✔ **Keyboard navigation on Favorites box:** It seems that the custom separator that I added to the Favorites box broke the keyboard navigation. I already know how to fix this. @fixed @done (16-12-09 10:03) @project(Custom Cinnamon Menu applet ToDo list)
 ✔ **Keyboard navigation for Custom Launchers box:** Currently, the keyboard navigation of this applet ignores the Custom Launchers box. I was avoiding the implementation of this due the complexity of the code. But now that the keyboard navigation code is more organized, I might give it a try. @implemented @done (16-12-01 21:22) @project(Custom Cinnamon Menu applet ToDo list)
 ✔ **Fix the known issue with keyboard navigation:** When enabled, the option **Display separator after "Recent Applications" category** will break the menu keyboard navigation. I was planning on removing this option all together, but I opted for keeping it and put a warning on the settings window until I figure out how to fix it. @fixed @done (16-12-01 21:22) @project(Custom Cinnamon Menu applet ToDo list)
