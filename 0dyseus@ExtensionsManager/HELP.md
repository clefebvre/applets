### Applet localization

- If this applet was installed from Cinnamon Settings, all of this applet's localizations were automatically installed.
- If this applet was installed manually and not trough Cinnamon Settings, localizations can be installed by executing the script called **localizations.sh** from a terminal opened inside the applet's folder.
- If this applet has no locale available for your language, you could create it by following [these instructions](https://github.com/Odyseus/CinnamonTools/wiki/Xlet-localization) and send the .po file to me.
    - If you have a GitHub account:
        - You could send a pull request with the new locale file.
        - If you don't want to clone the repository, just create a Gist and send me the link.
    - If you don't have/want a GitHub account:
        - You can send me a [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) (or similar service) to my [Mint Forums account](https://forums.linuxmint.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=164858).
- If the source text (in English) and/or my translation to Spanish has errors/inconsistencies, feel free to report them.
