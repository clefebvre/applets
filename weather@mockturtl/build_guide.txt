the Source code is in typescript now, You must compile it into js.
the Build script help to get them where they need to be in the correct
format.

Building requires Typescript installed (obviously).
To install typescript run: "sudo npm install -g typescript"  (requires node...)

Visual Studio Code has the best Typescript support, 
    although you can use other Text editor.



--------- BUILD -----------
FOR 3.8:
    Just run: "build-3.8.sh" script and you are good
    (It compiles to the correct JS target and moves the files into the folder 3.8)

FOR 3.0:
    Run "build-3.0.sh"
