the Source code is in typescript now, You must compile it into js.
the Build script help to get them where they need to be in the correct
format.

Building requires Typescript installed (obviously).
To install typescript run: "sudo npm install -g typescript"  (requires node...)

Visual Studio Code has the best Typescript support, 
    although you can use other Text editor.



--------- BUILD -----------
FOR 3.8:
    Just run: "build-3.8.sh" script and you are good
    (It compiles to the correct JS target and moves the files into the folder 3.8)

FOR 3.4: Just leave it be, but IF you REALLY need to:
    Run "build-3.4.py". requires Python 3.5+
    Then modify the output js ( 3.4/applet.js):
        *   Remove Requires and use normal class Initialisations
            for the previously imported modules (no "new ipApi.IpApi(this)", just  )
        *   ToLocaleTimeString() does not work, the whole "if" section
            needs to be uncommented in the 
            ParseWeather, PareswForecast function

    See previous outputs for reference.

    What happens in the script under is a bit more complicated:
        * Compiles to the correct JS target from Typescript
        * Adds any extra specified polyfills at the top of the file
            (currently only Array.includes)
        * Adds the other file's contents before main function
        * Moves the created file to the 3.4 folder
        * Cleans the rest of the js up.



    ANY NEW FILE WHAT YOU CREATE MUST BE APPENDED INTO THE "files" 
    variable into with is filename, classname, and what variablename
    you import it to! 

    Any other manitulation with the variable what the module was imported
    to will not be checked or removed.
