# TO DO

## In next versions (following v3.0.0):

If required by users, I project to:
  * Add an option to log VPN connections/disconnections for statistics.
  * Add a tool to append VPN connections from a .ovpn config file containing settings and certificates, for personal use only (not for system-wide use, which requires root privileges).
