            (Many thanks to the authors of these applets!)
            Works with Mint 18.2 and Cinnamon 3.2. It can be used on horizontal or vertical panel.
            Detects and displays correctly the status (connected/disconnected) of the VPN (the color of the icon changes).
            Can emit a sound alert when the VPN disconnect.
            Can try to reconnect to VPN when it has fallen.
            Can stop/restart Transmission when VPN disconnect/reconnect.
            A switch-button (into the menu) lets you manually connect/disconnect the VPN.
            Internationalization: 
                  There is a .pot file (in the 'po' subdirectory) to use with poedit to translate messages. 
                  The .po files created are automatically converted in .mo files, which are put into the right directories.
                  The translated messages will appear after the next Cinnamon startup.
                  Available languages  : English, French.
