Changelog

### 6.0.0

  * Reorganized and cleaned up a lot of code.
  * Disabled listing windows by monitor on the default configuration.
  * Fixed a couple performance bottlenecks during applet initialization, and cut down the start up time a lot.
  * Fixed an issue with window titles getting updated too frequently.
  * Fixed removing workspaces not having their corresponding objects in ITM removed.
  * Reduced a lot of redundancy in the focused window state handling logic.
  * Improved performance while switching between title display options.
  * Improved scaling for thumbnails on vertical panels.
  * Fixed the progress indicator being visible while inactive on some themes.
  * Fixed launchers being added through menu applets not being reflected in ITM.
  * Added support for pinning apps by dragging launchers from menu applets.
  * Added new thumbnail options for adjusting padding and the close button size.
  * Added an option to toggle the last active window thumbnail indicator in the thumbnail menu.
  * Known issues:
    * When repositioning the applet in panel edit mode on Cinnamon 3.2, the app buttons will become duplicated.
    * When label button modes are enabled, there isn't correct padding on pinned and inactive apps, or in focused mode, unfocused apps. Setting extra spacing in the options might help.
    * Restarting the applet through Melange or the dbus is not supported or guarunteed to be bug-free, and is only used during development. If you need to restart the applet, please restart Cinnamon.
