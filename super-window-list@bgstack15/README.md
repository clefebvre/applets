# Super Window List

##Overview
The Cinnamon built-in window list applet does not provide an option for viewing all windows across all workspaces. This applet adds a toggle switch in the settings, so you can turn on "Show Windows from All Workspaces."

## License
GPLv2, because of the re-use of Cinnamon components which are GPLv2.

## Features

   * A setting for "Show windows from all workspaces"
   * Whatever else the stock Cinnamon 3.4.6 window list provides

## Status
The author has little intention of carrying this forward, so if anyone volunteers to maintain/update/delete this applet, please feel free.

## Rationale
The builtin Cinnamon window list does not provide a toggle setting for "Show windows from all workspaces." This applet provides such a setting.

## Manual installation

1. Download and extract.
2. Copy directory files/super-window-list@bgstack15/ to ```~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/```
3. Visit the Cinnamon Menu > Cinnamon settings > Applets
4. Select "Super window list" and then "Add to panel"
5. For best results, remove from the panel the stock applet "Window list"

## Reference
This applet is a shameless duplicate and modification of window-list@cinnamon.org from package cinnamon-3.4.6-3.fc26.x86_64.
