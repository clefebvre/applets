This is a Cinnamon applet that provides access to some KDE Connect features.

## Requirements
This applet requires KDE Connect installed on your Linux Mint, and uses Nemo to open your device's shared folders.

## Installation
Download and enable via Cinnamon Settings.

## Peculiarities
This is not a bug of the applet, but do not disconnect your device from the computer or press "Unmount" until all the windows of Nemo with any device's shared folders are closed. If it happened, close all respective Nemo windows and press "Unmount", then "Mount and Explore" again. When I get to know, how to close the windows of Nemo showing shared folders, I will improve the applet.
