I used code from various applets as I couldn't find great doco on the web. I ended up finding some decent stuff from the GNOME3 site though, at least for the GSettings stuff.

I looked through the code in the following applets to help me learn what to do, and in some cases may have used some small segments of code from these applets:
* weather@mockturtl
* bluetooth@cinnamon.org
* trash@cinnamon.org
* xrandr@cinnamon.org

The weather applet was clear that it's licence was GPL3, so the licence for this applet will fall under GPL3 too (incase I used some code from there, not sure anymore).

I also retrieved the really nice looking icon from:
http://findicons.com/icon/94179/previewer?width=16
Icon Author: http://schollidesign.deviantart.com/

The icon is also GPL licenced. I wanted to use it, but after 15 minutes of trying to figure out how to display a bundled icon with the applet, I gave up.

Please drop me a note if you know a nice way of doing that!
