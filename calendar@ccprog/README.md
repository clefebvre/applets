This applet is a fork of Cinnamon's own calender. It adds the capability to mark
public holidays in the calender panel in addition to the weekend days.

Choose the Country and region for which to show the public holidays in the applet
settings page.

The holiday data are obtained from the webservice [Enrico](http://kayaposoft.com/enrico/)
by Kayaposoft.com.

> Enrico Service 2.0 is a free service written in PHP providing public holidays for several 
  countries. You can use Enrico Service to display public holidays on your website or in your 
  desktop application written in any programming language.  
  Enrico Service 2.0 is an open-source software licensed under the MIT License so you can 
  study, contribute, change or use it. See Enrico source code on Github.

See [here](http://holidays.kayaposoft.com/) for a list of supported countries and
its regions. It needs to be noted that each change to their list needs to be reflected
by an update to this applet. While I will try to keep track, if you notice something
missing in the applet that the service offers, let me know about it.

Both the list of supported countries and the actual holiday data are provided
by Enrico. If you find errors or have suggestions, please contact them directly
at enrico@kayaposoft.com or raise an issue at [Github](https://github.com/jurajmajer/enrico).

If you find bugs in the applet itself or know about other sources of holiday information
that can be included as webservices, please
[tell me about them](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/issues).
