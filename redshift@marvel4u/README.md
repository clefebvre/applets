# Redshift applet

A simple applet that allows quick activation and configuration of the red filter provided by redshift. It supports manual change of the temperature and brightness which is not possible in the redshift-gtk.

It does not toggle the gradual day time dependent transition atm since I personally don't use it.

Icon is the repurposed from keybord-backlight symbol that I have never seen used anywhere.


## Installing

1) Add redshift: sudo apt-get install redshift

2) Extract to ~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets

3) Enable the applet in cinnamon settings


## Changelog
