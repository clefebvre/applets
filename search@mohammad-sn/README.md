**Search** is an applet that adds indexing and search capability to your Cinnamon desktop. 

Once installed and added to the panel, click on the applet and start typing; results will show up as you type. Selecting an item will open it with user's preferred application. To open the folder containing the result entry, click on the folder icon on the right side of the menu. In order to open the file with another application, right click on it and select the application you want. You should specify indexed directories in the applet's configuration window.

**Search** uses a modified version of mlocate/updatedb in order to search for files. mlocate has been originally authored by Miloslav Trmac.
